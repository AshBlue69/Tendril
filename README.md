Tendril 1.0 – The Story of Its Creation

---

Tendril 1.0 came into being over the course of a few intense, curious hours. The idea started simple: a sketch that feels alive, that flows organically, and reacts subtly to whoever interacts with it. I wanted it to have fibers, pulses, hidden surprises—a little world that grows when explored. But turning that vision into reality was anything but simple.

At first, I knew the philosophy but not the execution. How to structure the folder? How to make it portable yet immersive? How to make the sketch itself feel alive? That’s when ChatGPT became my collaborator. Every idea, every question, every tweak went through an iterative dialogue. Sometimes it worked perfectly; other times, outputs were bizarre, unexpected, or hilariously wrong—but even those failures sparked new ideas.

Some of the most memorable struggles:  
- Trying to make tendrils move in a way that felt organic without turning the sketch into a chaotic mess.  
- Figuring out folder structure that is minimal, yet itself carries character. I went back and forth on folder names for longer than I’d like to admit.  
- Making the sketch portable and offline-ready: a missing semicolon, a misplaced asset path, or a weird preload bug would derail things for a few minutes, until suddenly it clicked.  

Every iteration revealed new possibilities. Hidden paths, subtle ambient cues, playful naming, tiny easter eggs—these were ideas that evolved organically during the process. Some came directly from me, some emerged from ChatGPT’s suggestions, and some were born out of experimentation after a failed attempt. Each “mistake” became a small discovery.

In the end, Tendril 1.0 is more than a sketch. It’s the product of curiosity, trial and error, and collaboration. The fibers in `sketch.js` are traces of the process; the assets, the README, the cover image, even the folder structure—they all carry the personality of these hours of creation. It is minimal, portable, and ready to be explored, but it’s also a record of a journey: of ideas, struggles, and discoveries.

Tendril 1.0 is alive not just in code, but in the story of how it came to exist. Open it. Explore it. Notice the small surprises. Each interaction continues the journey.
